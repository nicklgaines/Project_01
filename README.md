# Project_01 The Parable of Joy


Welcome to a Vanilla JS/HTML5/CSS3 clone of the Stanley Parable, courtesy of Valve Corporation. In this game you will:

* **Make choices**
* **Suffer the consequences of those choices** & **Make additional choices**
* **Ponder Your Existence**
*  **Experience a sense of nihilism**
* **Feel inspired to make your own silly adventure game**

### User Story

*  **The player starts in a room**
*  **The room contains context** either as a media file or animation
*  **The room contains instructions** in the form of text
*  **The room contains choices** represented by buttons
*  **The player makes a choice by pressing a button**
*  **The player is transported to a new room**
*  **The player wins by finding the meaning of life hidden within room.fortyTwo (teehee), or by finding all story endings.**

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Blackjack
Make a one player game where people can win big by guessing which card the computer will deal next!  Start with the Ace equalling 1 or 11... not both.  Once that is 100% working, you can work to make the Ace value changeable.  

##### Self-scoring Trivia
Test your wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!
